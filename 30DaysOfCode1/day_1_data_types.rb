# input is unknown

i = 4
d = 4.0
s = 'HackerRank '
# Declare second integer, double, and String variables.
a = 0
b = 0.0
c = ""

# Read and save an integer, double, and String to your variables.
# Use gets to read and save input

a = gets.to_i
b = gets.to_f
c = gets.to_s


# Print the sum of both integer variables on a new line.

puts i + a

# Print the sum of the double variables on a new line.

puts b + d
# Concatenate and print the String variables on a new line
# The 's' variable above should be printed first.

puts s + c
